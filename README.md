# AgentForge

AgentForge is an AI-powered web application development platform designed to streamline the web application design, coding, and deployment processes using AI agents. It targets web developers, businesses, and entrepreneurs who seek to enhance productivity, reduce costs, and accelerate time-to-market for web applications.

## Overview

AgentForge is built using a monolithic architecture to facilitate rapid development. The backend is powered by Node.js with Express, handling server-side logic and routing, while MongoDB is utilized to store user data and project information. The frontend is crafted with Bootstrap for responsive design, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices. Communication between the frontend and backend is managed through RESTful APIs. The platform integrates AI services for automated task handling and supports deployment to major cloud platforms via external APIs.

### Project Structure

- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MongoDB
- Frontend: Bootstrap
- AI Integration: OpenAI API for generating code
- Deployment: Integration with cloud platforms like Heroku
- Source Control: Git for version control

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Natural Language Project Creation**: Users can input project descriptions in plain language, which are then converted into actionable development tasks.
- **AI-Driven Development**: AI agents autonomously handle the design, coding, and testing phases of the web application development.
- **Automated Testing and Deployment**: The platform generates test suites and manages deployment across different cloud environments.
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: Provides interfaces for developers to review, tweak, and enhance AI-generated code.

### User Flow
