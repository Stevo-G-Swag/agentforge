# AgentForge

AgentForge is an AI-powered web application development platform designed to automate the process of web application design, coding, and deployment. By leveraging specialized AI agents, AgentForge streamlines the development process, enabling web developers, businesses, and entrepreneurs to efficiently create robust web applications with minimal human intervention.

## Overview

### Architecture
AgentForge utilizes a monolithic architecture, which is ideal for the platform's initial scope and the need for rapid development. The backend is built using Node.js with Express, handling server-side logic and routing. MongoDB is employed as the database, storing user data and project information, thanks to its flexible schema design. The frontend is crafted with Bootstrap, ensuring a responsive design that adapts to both desktop and mobile devices. Communication between the frontend and backend is facilitated through RESTful APIs. The platform integrates with AI services and external APIs for version control and deployment to cloud platforms.

### Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database known for its high performance and flexibility.
- **Bootstrap**: A front-end framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
- **Other Libraries**: Mongoose, axios, dotenv, bcrypt, express-session, connect-mongo, ejs, and more.

## Features

- **Natural Language Project Creation**: Users can describe their desired web application in plain language, which the platform interprets to create a development plan.
- **AI-Driven Development**: AI agents collaborate to design, code, and test the web application, significantly reducing the need for human coding.
- **Automated Testing and Deployment**: The platform automates testing and deploys applications across various cloud platforms, ensuring scalability and robustness.
- **Intelligent Component Library**: Reusable components and design patterns are adapted for each project, enhancing development efficiency.
- **Human-AI Collaboration**: While AI handles most of the development, intuitive interfaces allow human developers to make necessary adjustments to the AI-generated code.
